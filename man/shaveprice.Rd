\description{
Upper and lower bound on prices have to be
checked and quantity replaced accordingly
This function comes after estimatequantity()
and after addpartnerflow()
check this order in the source of the clean() function.
Check unit price for all flows
recalculate unit price based on quantity estimate
Those which have been estimated from tradevalue will have correct prices
Those which have been estimated from weight might be changed as well
Split trade flows between those which are within the price bounds
and those which are out of the price bounds.
For trade flows outside the price bounds,
use the unit price to estimate the quantity
