* If the quantity is in kg or m3 take the quantity
he doesn't bother with the weight because the volume is already there
* If he has only the kilos, he will convert using one conversion factor for the entire world.
* If neither volume nor quantity is there use a unit price to calculate the quantity

Goal:
For wood products Goal is to have a correct volume in m3
For paper products is to have a correct weight

## Price discrepancies
Calculate median unit price,
```{r}
print(load("data-raw/comtrade/440799.RData"))
swd99 <- dtf %>% 
    renamecolumns %>%
    filter(flow %in% c("Import", "Export")) %>%
    merge(select(reportercomtrade, reportercode, region, subregion)) %>%
    mutate(price = tradevalue / quantity)

#table of median flow prices
swd99subregion <- swd99 %>% 
    group_by(flow,subregion) %>%
    summarise(lowerprice = round(0.5 * quantile(price, 0.25, 
                                                names=FALSE, na.rm=TRUE)),
              medianprice = round(median(price, na.rm=TRUE)),
              upperprice = round(2 * quantile(price, 0.75,
                                              names=FALSE, na.rm=TRUE))) %>%
    arrange(-medianprice)
 
lowerprice =
